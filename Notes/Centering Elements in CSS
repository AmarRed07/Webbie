- Center items in the body:

body {
    text-align: center;
}

This will align everything in the body to be centered. This works only on inline-block
or full width elements. If you add a width to a certain element, then text-align 
won't work on that given tag or element anymore.

- MARGINS

Centering a margin:

.element {
    margin: 0 (top) auto (right) 0 (bottom) auot (left);
}

4 inputs:
When putting for inputs into the margin then first input is top, second is right,
it is counter clockwise from then. 

1 input:
Will aling all 4 sides

2 inputs:
First input will be top and bottom, and second input is left and right.
So:

.element {
    margin: 2px (top and bottom) 2 px (left and right);
}

3 inputs:
    First input is top, second is left and right, third is bottom.
