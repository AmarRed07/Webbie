-CLEAR

If you wanted to float an image to the left, say for a blog, but you wanted the image to just float to the
left while keeping the header in the middle and the P to go underneath - then you'd use clear.

So the p would be:

.p {
    clear: left;
}

If you wanted it on the right, then you would just float it too the right. 
*******This clears anything to the left of the <p></p> that way the image still floats left but NOT to
the left of the <p></p>
