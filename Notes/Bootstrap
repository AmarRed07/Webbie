Bootstrap has built in CSS code, and HTML code already that you can utilze with
bootstrap selectors. For example:

in HTML you would have to make the class:

<button class="btn"> Submit </button>

then in CSS:

.btn {
    code
    code
    code
    code
    code
}

However, with bootstrap - all you'd have to do is put in the bootstrap selectors in
the HTML. So you'd not have to write it in the CSS technically, and it will have 
predetermined styles for you - that you could of course customize later.

bootstrap:

<button class="btn btn-primary" > Submit </button>

This would give the primary button style to "submit".
